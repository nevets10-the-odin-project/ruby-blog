# Project: Blog App

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-blog-app

## Introduction

In this project, you’ll get the opportunity to actually build a real Rails application. It’s not a trivially simple one either – it’s got a lot of wrinkles and things that you’re not going to understand.

To be honest, you’re kind of going into the deep end so don’t worry if you don’t understand what exactly you’re doing in all the steps. The point here is to get familiar with the process of creating a Rails app, what things generally look like, and what you don’t know. When you get to the end of this project, you can consider yourself remarkably persistent and resilient.

## Note

I forgot to write a post project review for this project. This took me a few days to compelte, so it was moderately difficult. I believe the biggest learning curve was using Active Record instead of writing SQL. I've been writing PL/SQL for over six years now professionally, so trying to not use it was difficult at first.
